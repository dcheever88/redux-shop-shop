# redux-shop-shop

An e-commerce website with a variety of products. Users can log-in, add items into and remove items from a shopping cart, and checkout. Users can also view their order history. Data persists for users on multiple visits.

## User Story
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
